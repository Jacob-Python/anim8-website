			<h1>How-tos for Anim8</h1>
			<h3>Topic 1. Workflow</h3>
			<p>First, you build models. Then, you apply animations. Finally, you render.</p>

			<h4>1.1. Opening/Making Projects</h4>
			<p>To make a project, fill out the name field and hit Create. The file is saved in (on Windows) C:/Users/namehere/Documents/anim8/insert name here/insert name here.a8p.</p>
			<p>To open a project, select a project from the menu and hit Open.</p>
			<p>UI below.</p>

			<h4>1.2. Making/Opening/Editing Models</h4>
			<p>Anim8 gives you all of the key shortcuts nicely listed out at the bottom of the window,<br>as seen below and circled for brevity here.</p>
			<img src="screen-02.png" alt="Key example">	
			<p>To color elements of a model, use the RGB color form, seen here.</p>
			<img src="color.png" alt="RGB color form">
			<p>If you are opening a model from a file, you will see the Model Selection form. Just enter a model number below the limit in the box, circled for brevity here.
				<ul>
					<li>Hit Select to view/edit model.</li>
					<li>Hit Delete Selected to delete selected model.</li>
					<li>Hit Update Selected to set selected's file code to model in view.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h4>1.3. Animating Models</h4>
			<p>To create an animation, select the model to apply the animation to. Select a transform from the dropdown. Then, enter a number if you're scaling or a coordinate pair like this one: 3,4. Then hit apply. The animation will appear on the list, as seen in the image below.</p>
			<p>To delete an animation from the current frame, enter its number in the Delete field and hit the Delete button, seen below.</p>
			<img src="makeanim.png" alt="Applying an animation">
			<p>To combine the transforms into a frame, hit Merge all into frame, then hit Yes on the popup, as seen here.<br>Also, to save the current frames, hit Save animation.</p>
			<img src="mergeanim.png" alt="Merging transforms into a frame">
			<p>If you opened a file, you will see these buttons. Here's what they do.<ul>
				<li>Use the Previous and Next buttons to scroll through the animations in the file.</li>
				<li>Use the Delete button to delete the selected animation from the file.</li>
				<li>Use the Update button to set the selected frame&apos;s code in the file to the frame being worked on.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<img src="fileopsa.png" alt="If you opened a file, you'll see this.">
			<p>To render out your animation, hit Render animation. To preview it, hit Preview animation. A window will pop up, showing the frames of the animation. The animation frame images will be in (on Windows) C:/Users/namehere/Documents/anim8/insert name here/frames. Then the frames will be made into a video, which you can find in (on Windows) C:/Users/namehere/Documents/anim8/insert name here/insert name here.mp4.
